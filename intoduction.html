git is a version control system that allows you to
- track changes in files

- collaborate with other developers


to get started, you need to install git on your computer.
you can download it from git-scm.com

1- open the terminal
2- type git --version
3- you should see something like this: git version 2.17.1

now you are ready to start using git!

git commands
1-git init - creates a new git repository (ls -a to see hidden files)

2-git status - inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
    untracked files - files that are not being tracked by git
    unmodified files - files that have not been changed since the last commit
    modified files - files that have been changed since the last commit

3-git add - adds files from the working directory to the staging area
    git add <file name> - adds a specific file
