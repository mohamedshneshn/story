what is git?
git is a version control system that allows you to
- track changes in files
- roll back to a previous version
- collaborate with other developers


git stages : working directory, staging area, local repository, remote repository
working directory: where you make changes to your files
staging area: where you add files to be committed to the local repository 
local repository: where your changes are saved locally on your computer (git init)
remote repository: where your changes are saved on a remote server (github, bitbucket, gitlab)


to get started, you need to install git on your computer.
you can download it from https://git-scm.com/downloads 

1- open the terminal
2- type git --version
3- you should see something like this: git version 2.17.1

now you are ready to start using git!

git commands
1-git init - creates a new git repository (ls -a to see hidden files)

2-git status - inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
    untracked files - files that are not being tracked by git
    unmodified files - files that have not been changed since the last commit
    modified files - files that have been changed since the last commit

3-git add - adds files from the working directory to the staging area
    git add <file name> - adds a specific file
    git add . - adds all files in the current directory
    git add -A - adds all files in the current directory and subdirectories

4- git -rm --cached -r <file name>    - removes a file from the staging area
  git -rm --cached  -r .              - removes all files from the staging area
 
  

4-git commit - takes files from the staging area and saves them in the repository
    git commit -m "commit message" - commits the staged snapshot with a message
    git commit -am "commit message" - stages all modified and deleted files and commits them with a message


5-git log - shows a list of all previous commits
    git log --oneline - shows a list of all previous commits in one line
    git log --oneline --graph - shows a list of all previous commits in one line with a graph



6-git checkout - rollbacks changes to a previous version
    git checkout file name - restores a specific file to a previous version.
    git checkout <commit> <file> - restores a specific file to a specific commit
    git checkout <commit> - restores all files to a specific commit
    git checkout master - restores all files to the most recent commit

7-git diff - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
    git diff <file> - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area for a specific file
    git diff - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area for all files

how to create a remote repository on github

3-git remote add origin https://github.com/mohamedshneshn/ooooo.git (add the remote repository to your local repository)
4- git push -u origin main (push your local repository to the remote repository)


              <!-- -------------------------------------------------------------- -->
how to push changes to github

2- type git add .
3- type git commit -m "commit message"

why do we use branches?
1-branch makes a copy of the main branch and allows you to work on it without affecting the main branch.
2-branches allow you to work on different versions of a repository at the same time
  by isolating your work from the main branch.
3-branches allow you to collaborate with other developers on the same project.
4-branches allow you to test new features without affecting the main branch.

 git merge (name of the branch you want to merge)        - merges the branch to the main branch
 git push -u origin main                                 - pushes the changes to the remote repository

what is a fork and how to fork a repository from github ?

1- a fork is a copy of a repository
2- to fork a repository from github, click on the fork button on the top right corner of the repository page

1- a fork is a copy of a repository on github
2- a clone is a copy of a repository on your computer

what is a pull request ?

1- a pull request is a way to notify the owner of a repository that you have made changes to a fork of
 their repository and you would like them to consider merging those changes into
 the original repository.
