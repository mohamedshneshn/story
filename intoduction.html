what is git?
git is a version control system that allows you to
- track changes in files
- roll back to a previous version
- collaborate with other developers


to get started, you need to install git on your computer.
you can download it from git-scm.com

1- open the terminal
2- type git --version
3- you should see something like this: git version 2.17.1

now you are ready to start using git!

git commands
1-git init - creates a new git repository (ls -a to see hidden files)

2-git status - inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
    untracked files - files that are not being tracked by git
    unmodified files - files that have not been changed since the last commit
    modified files - files that have been changed since the last commit

3-git add - adds files from the working directory to the staging area
    git add <file name> - adds a specific file
    git add . - adds all files in the current directory
    git add -A - adds all files in the current directory and subdirectories

4-git commit - takes files from the staging area and saves them in the repository
    git commit -m "commit message" - commits the staged snapshot with a message
    git commit -am "commit message" - stages all modified and deleted files and commits them with a message


5-git log - shows a list of all previous commits
    git log --oneline - shows a list of all previous commits in one line
    git log --oneline --graph - shows a list of all previous commits in one line with a graph
