what is git?
git is a version control system that allows you to
- track changes in files
- roll back to a previous version
- collaborate with other developers


git stages : working directory, staging area, local repository, remote repository
working directory: where you make changes to your files
staging area: where you add files to be committed to the local repository 
local repository: where your changes are saved locally on your computer (git init)
remote repository: where your changes are saved on a remote server (github, bitbucket, gitlab)


to get started, you need to install git on your computer.
you can download it from https://git-scm.com/downloads 

1- open the terminal
2- type git --version
3- you should see something like this: git version 2.17.1

now you are ready to start using git!

git commands
1-git init - creates a new git repository (ls -a to see hidden files)

2-git status - inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
    untracked files - files that are not being tracked by git
    unmodified files - files that have not been changed since the last commit
    modified files - files that have been changed since the last commit

3-git add - adds files from the working directory to the staging area
    git add <file name> - adds a specific file
    git add . - adds all files in the current directory
    git add -A - adds all files in the current directory and subdirectories

4- git -rm --cached -r <file name>    - removes a file from the staging area
  git -rm --cached  -r .              - removes all files from the staging area
 
  

4-git commit - takes files from the staging area and saves them in the repository
    git commit -m "commit message" - commits the staged snapshot with a message
    git commit -am "commit message" - stages all modified and deleted files and commits them with a message


5-git log - shows a list of all previous commits
    git log --oneline - shows a list of all previous commits in one line
    git log --oneline --graph - shows a list of all previous commits in one line with a graph



6-git checkout - rollbacks changes to a previous version
    git checkout file name - restores a specific file to a previous version.
    git checkout <commit> <file> - restores a specific file to a specific commit
    git checkout <commit> - restores all files to a specific commit
    git checkout master - restores all files to the most recent commit

7-git diff - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
    git diff <file> - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area for a specific file
    git diff - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area for all files

how to create a remote repository on github
1- create a new repository on github
2- git branch -M main (change the default branch name from master to main)
3-git remote add origin https://github.com/mohamedshneshn/ooooo.git (add the remote repository to your local repository)
4- git push -u origin main (push your local repository to the remote repository)


              <!-- -------------------------------------------------------------- -->
how to push changes to github
1- open the terminal
2- type git add .
3- type git commit -m "commit message"
4- type git push

               <!-- -------------------------------------------------------------- -->
how to pull changes from github
1- open the terminal
2- type git pull
                <!-- -------------------------------------------------------------- -->

how to ignore files (node_modules, .env, .DS_Store, api keys, passwords, etc)
1- create a .gitignore file
2- add the files you want to ignore to the .gitignore file
3- git add .
4- git commit -m "commit message"
5- git push

what is DS_Store?
DS_Store is a file that stores custom attributes of its containing folder, such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image. It is used by the Finder on Mac OS X and by the Explorer on Windows. It is also used by some other applications, like the X11 window manager on Unix-like systems.

how to clone a repository from github to your computer (git clone)

                <!-- -----------------------------------------------------------  -->

why do we use branches?
1-branches allow you to work on different versions of a repository at the same time
  by isolating your work from the main branch.
2-branches allow you to collaborate with other developers on the same project.
3-branches allow you to test new features without affecting the main branch.


              
how to create a new branch (git branch)

git branch <branch name>   - creates a new branch
git branch                 - shows a list of all branches
git checkout (name of the branch you want to switch to) - switches to a specific branch


how to merge a branch to the main branch (git merge)

 git checkout main                                       - switches to the main branch
 git merge (name of the branch you want to merge)        - merges the branch to the main branch
 git push                                                - pushes the changes to the remote repository


 
how to delete a branch (git branch -d)
1- open the terminal
2- type git branch -d (name of the branch you want to delete)

how to create a new branch and switch to it (git checkout -b)
1- open the terminal
2- type git checkout -b (name of the branch you want to create)
